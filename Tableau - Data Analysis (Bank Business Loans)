Kindly follow the link below to view the tableau visualization I created from the attached dataset. 

The analysis looks at a bank's business loans. The dashboard shows the bank's loans in terms of loan amounts and amounts written off by state and county.
The analysis shows that there is a positive correlation between the size of the loan and the amount of the loan
to be written off.
